# SVPHM AMS Web App

Intended for use as an **iOS** web app, while waiting on the creation of an SVHA Apple Developer Account. For Android users, the app can be downloaded from the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adrianwong.svphm.ams_app).

## Usage
To use the app as intended:
* Navigate to [https://svphm-ams.github.io/ams-app/](https://svphm-ams.github.io/ams-app/) in Safari
* Click on the "Share" <img src="share-button.png"> button
* Click on the "Add to Home Screen" button
* Follow the prompt to add the app to the home screen
* Open the app from the home screen

The app can still be accessed from the browser, but has some unintended behaviour due to Apple permanently enabling pinch-to-zoom for accessibility reasons even when the viewport setting has been set to `user-scalable=no`. See: [What's New in Safari 10.0](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewInSafari/Articles/Safari_10_0.html).
